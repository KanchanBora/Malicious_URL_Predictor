# Malicious_URL_Predictor

The Malicious URL Predictor is a machine learning project focused on 
developing a reliable model to classify URLs as either malicious or benign. The 
primary objective of this project is to enhance cybersecurity measures by 
identifying potentially harmful URLs in real-time. 
The methodology involved includes data collection, preprocessing, feature 
extraction using tokenization, and training various machine learning models. 
The key findings from the project encompassed the performance evaluation of 
different models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression 
with both TF-IDF and Count Vectorization.
The project's conclusion highlighted the successful creation of a robust 
Malicious URL Predictor, capable of efficiently distinguishing between 
malicious and safe URLs. Future improvements, ethical considerations, and the 
potential real-time deployment of the model were also addressed. 
The Malicious URL Predictor represents a significant advancement in 
cybersecurity, contributing to a safer and more secure internet environment for 
users.
